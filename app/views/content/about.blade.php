            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I created this site as a side project for my programming and hardware experimentation. I only work on this project at nights and on weekends whenever I may have some spare time.</p>
            <p>All of the hardware experimentation occurred over the summer of 2013. During the fall I worked on version 1 using Zend Framework 2 and Zend Server on AWS EC2.</p>
